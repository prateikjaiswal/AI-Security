Great! I've successfully set up a Python environment for your AI Security Training projects. Here's what I've done:

Created a virtual environment (venv) using Python 3.13.3
Created a compatible requirements file that works with your Python version
Successfully installed the core libraries needed for your AI security projects
The installation was successful for most of the key libraries including:

adversarial-robustness-toolbox
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
opencv-python
huggingface-hub
transformers
flask
jupyter
Note that TensorFlow wasn't installed because it's not yet compatible with Python 3.13. If you need to run projects that specifically require TensorFlow, you might need to:

Install a different Python version (3.10 or 3.11 would be ideal)
Create a new virtual environment with that Python version
Install TensorFlow in that environment
To activate and use your current environment, you can run:

bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
source venv/bin/activate
To run any of the projects, navigate to the specific project directory and run the main Python file. For example:

bash
CopyInsert
cd 01-Fwaf-Machine-Learning-driven-Web-Application-Firewall
python main.py  # or whatever the main file is called
